# Standards Coverage Analysis Guide  

Use this section to judge **how completely** the lesson set addresses every element of the target standard and to pinpoint any gaps.

---

## 1. Prepare a Requirement List  
1. Read the full standard, clarifications, and examples
2. Bullet every discrete requirement—concepts, skills, representations, contexts, and grade-level limits.  
3. Keep this list visible while evaluating lessons.

---

## 2. Map Lessons to Requirements  
| Requirement | Lesson(s) Addressing It | Evidence / Notes | Coverage Status |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| e.g., “Solve multi-step word problems with unit fractions.” | Lesson 2, Lesson 4 | Lesson 2 models; Lesson 4 practice set | ✔ Met |
| *(repeat for each requirement)* |  |  | ◑ Partially Met / ✗ Not Met |

**Coverage Status codes**  
- **✔ Met** – requirement is fully addressed somewhere in the collection.  
- **◑ Partially Met** – requirement is present but depth, variety, or representation is insufficient.  
- **✗ Not Met** – requirement is absent.

---

## 3. Identify Redundancies & Gaps  
* **Redundancies**: Note any requirements covered by multiple lessons with identical approach or examples.  
* **Gaps**: List requirements marked ◑ or ✗.

---

## 4. Explain Missing Elements (for each Gap)  
- Quote or paraphrase the requirement.  
- State **exactly** what is missing (content, skill, representation, context, depth).  
- Example:  
  > **Requirement:** “Students create line plots to display measurement data.”  
  > **Gap:** No lesson asks students to generate their own line plots—only interpret pre-made ones.

---

## 5. Summarize Overall Coverage  
Provide a concise narrative or bullet list answering:  
- Which requirements are fully met?  
- Which are partially or not met, and why?  
- Where does excessive overlap occur?

### Output Template
```markdown
## Coverage Analysis
- Requirement 1: ✔ Met — Lesson X models and practice cover all expectations.  
- Requirement 2: ◑ Partially Met — Lessons Y & Z introduce concept but lack multi-step applications.  
- Requirement 3: ✗ Not Met — No lesson addresses student-generated line plots.  

## Missing Elements
- Multi-step contextual problems using unit fractions.  
- Student-created line plots from measurement data.  

## Redundancies
- Lessons 3 & 5 both reteach the same single-step fraction models without added depth.
